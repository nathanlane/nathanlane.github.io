Whelp, this is the template for the new version of my blog. It's be recoded for use with Forestry.io. I also built the style of the website off their modular uBuild framework--along with some CSS hacking and adding my own Liquid template coding to integrate a blog into their framework. Feel free to email about this.

`ubuild-jekyll` is a Jekyll theme desgined to work with [Forestry](https://forestry.io/)'s [Blocks](https://forestry.io/blog/blocks-give-your-editors-the-power-to-build-pages/) feature.
