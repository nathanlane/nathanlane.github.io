# Readme for the page.
This webpage is cobbled together using the uBuild Jekyll theme, with CSS reworked by me, and with an integrated blog hacked together with Jekyll's Liquid templating language. It's currently very rough. 

# uBuild Jekyll Theme
[View the announcement post on Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/blog/ubuild-a-new-theme-for-static-sites-using-blocks/#/)

`ubuild-jekyll` is a Jekyll theme desgined to work with [Forestry](https://forestry.io/)'s [Blocks](https://forestry.io/blog/blocks-give-your-editors-the-power-to-build-pages/) feature.  This theme provides a set of page-level components and a pre-configured Forestry Blocks UI that will empower content editors to construct their own webpages.
