    Multinationals on the Global Periphery</strong></a> <strong>(December 2020)</strong>
    - with David Kreitmeir and Paul Raschky. </p><p>Civil society is essential to
    governance, especially where laws and authority are weak. We study how a core
    strategy of international civil society groups - informing and publicizing human
    rights abuses - impacts those tied to abuse. Our study focuses on a major trend
    at the center of on-going international media campaigns: the assassination of
    civil society activists involved in mining activity. Collecting and coding 20
    years of data on assassination events, we use Event Study Methodology to study
    how publicity of these events impact the asset prices of firms associated with
    abuse. We show that publicizing abuses has a significant impact on multinationals.
    Firm''s associated with an assassination have large, negative abnormal returns
    following the event. We calculate a median loss in market capitalisation of over
    100 million USD, ten days following violence. We highlight the role of media publicity
    in our results. We show negative returns from assassinations are stronger during
    periods of low media pressure, versus when they coincide with competing newsworthy
    events. As well, we argue our results are driven by events where companies are
    explicitly named in media publicity, using a set of placebo events where no firms
    were identified by news coverage. Furthermore, we reject that our results are
    driven by other forms of unrest and conflict. Last, we show activist assassinations
    are positively related to the royalties paid by firms to domestic governments.<br></p><hr><p><strong><br></strong><a

    title=""><strong>The New Empirics of Industrial Policy</strong></a><strong> (January
    2020) - </strong>Review article, requested for Dani Rodrik''s volume of<strong>
    </strong>Journal of Industry, Competition and Trade.<strong><br></strong><br><strong>Abstract</strong>
    - Nations have and will continue to shape their economies through industrial policy.
    Nevertheless, the empirical literature on these interventions is thin, dwarfed
    by the attention these policies receive by policymakers across the world. In this
    paper, I discuss the difficulties of empirically studying industrial policy, and
    review how new econometric work is confronting these issues. Through careful research
    design and attention to institutional detail, I argue that emergent evaluations
    are rapidly expanding what we know—and updating what we thought we knew—about
    these policies. This review is a proposal to take industrial interventions, along
    with all their complexities, more seriously as objects of inquiry. Doing so requires
    more serious evaluations of past policy, but also a reevaluation of prior empirical
    work and consensus.</p><p></p><hr><p><a href="https://nathanlane.github.io/assets/papers/ManufacturingRevolutions_Lane_Live.pdf"

    in South Korea</strong></a><strong> (2019)<br></strong><br>[Previously titled:
    Manufacturing Revolutions - Industrial Policy and Networks in South Korea]</p><p><strong><br>Abstract</strong>
    - I study the impact of industrial policy on industrial development through a
    canonical intervention. Following a political crisis in 1972, South Korea dramatically
    altered its development strategy with a new sector-specific policy: the Heavy
    Chemical and Industry (HCI) drive. With newly digitized data, I use the sharp
    introduction and withdrawal of HCI trade policy and investment incentives to study
    its impacts. (1) I show HCI successfully promoted the evolution of directly treated
    industries. Next I provide evidence for two key justifications of industrial policy:
    network and dynamic externalities. (2) Using variation in exposure to policies
    through the input-output network, I show HCI indirectly benefited (non-treated)
    downstream industry. (3) Finally, I show both direct and indirect benefits of
    HCI persist even after the policy is withdrawn, following the 1979 assassination
    of President Park. Together, my findings suggest that the temporary drive helped
    shift the economy into higher value-added activity.<br></p>'
