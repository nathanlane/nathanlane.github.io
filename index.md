    in South Korea</strong></a><strong> (2019)<br></strong><br>[Previously titled:
    Manufacturing Revolutions - Industrial Policy and Networks in South Korea]</p><p><strong><br>Abstract</strong>
    - I study the impact of industrial policy on industrial development through a
    canonical intervention. Following a political crisis in 1972, South Korea dramatically
    altered its development strategy with a new sector-specific policy: the Heavy
    Chemical and Industry (HCI) drive. With newly digitized data, I use the sharp
    introduction and withdrawal of HCI trade policy and investment incentives to study
    its impacts. (1) I show HCI successfully promoted the evolution of directly treated
    industries. Next I provide evidence for two key justifications of industrial policy:
    network and dynamic externalities. (2) Using variation in exposure to policies
    through the input-output network, I show HCI indirectly benefited (non-treated)
    downstream industry. (3) Finally, I show both direct and indirect benefits of
    HCI persist even after the policy is withdrawn, following the 1979 assassination
    of President Park. Together, my findings suggest that the temporary drive helped
    shift the economy into higher value-added activity.<br></p><hr><p><a href="https://nathanlane.github.io/assets/papers/NathanLane_New_Empirics_of_Industrial_Policy_current.pdf"
    title=""><strong>The New Empirics of Industrial Policy</strong></a><strong> (Updated,
    2019) - </strong>Review article, requested for Dani Rodrik''s volume of<strong>
    </strong>Journal of Industry, Competition and Trade.<strong><br></strong><br><strong>Abstract</strong>
    - Nations have and will continue to shape their economies through industrial policy.
    Nevertheless, the empirical literature on these interventions is thin, dwarfed
    by the attention these policies receive by policymakers across the world. In this
    paper, I discuss the difficulties of empirically studying industrial policy, and
    review how new econometric work is confronting these issues. Through careful research
    design and attention to institutional detail, I argue that emergent evaluations
    are rapidly expanding what we know—and updating what we thought we knew—about
    these policies. This review is a proposal to take industrial interventions, along
    with all their complexities, more seriously as objects of inquiry. Doing so requires
    more serious evaluations of past policy, but also a reevaluation of prior empirical
    work and consensus.</p>'
