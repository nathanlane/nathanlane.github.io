  <h2>Job Market Paper</h2>

  <p><h4>Manufacturing Revolutions [Coming soon]</h4>Industrial Policy and Networks in South Korea</br></p>

  <p>
	<b>Abstract</b> - This paper uses a natural experiment and a newly digitized database from South Korea to estimate the causal effect of industrial policy on (short and long-run) industrial development. In 1973 South Korea transitioned to a military dictatorship and drastically changed their development strategy; using this sudden political-economic transition, I find industries targeted by big push-style industrial policy grew significantly more than non-targeted industries along several key dimensions of industrial development. These developmental effects persisted after industrial policies were retrenched, following the 1979 assassination of the big push’s chief architect, president Park Chung-hee. Furthermore, I estimate the spillovers of the industrial policies using exogenous variation in the exposure to the policy across the input-output network. In doing so, I find evidence of persistent pecuniary externalities, similar to those posited by classic theorists of big push development policy, such as Albert Hirschman. In other words, I find that South Korea’s controversial industrial policy was successful in producing industrial development, the benefits of which persisted through time and in industries not directly targeted by the policies.
