  	<p>
  	My research broadly focuses on economic development, political economy, and economic history. Specifically, I am interested in topics of industrial development; the political economy of development strategy; long-run growth; and elite politics. My studies focus on Asian economic development, using historical and archival data.

  <p>
	<b>Abstract</b> - This paper uses a natural experiment and newly digitized data from South Korea to estimate the causal effect of industrial policy on short and long-run industrial development. In 1973 South Korea transitioned to a military dictatorship and drastically changed their development strategy; using this sudden political economy transition, I find industries targeted by big push-style industrial policy grew signficantly more than non-targeted industries along several key dimensions of industrial development. These developmental effects persisted long after industrial policies were retrenched, following the 1979 assassination of the South Korean president, the big push’s chief architect. Furthermore, I estimate the spillovers of the industrial policies using exogenous variation in the exposure to the policy across the input-output network. In doing so, I find evidence of persistent pecuniary externalities, similar to those posited by classic theorists of big push development policy, such as Albert Hirschman. To conclude, I find that South Korea’s controversial industrial policies were successful in producing industrial development, the benefits of which persisted through time and in industries not directly targeted by the policies.
