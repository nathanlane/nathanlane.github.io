  	My research broadly focuses on economic development, political economy, economic history, and growth. Specifically, I study issues of industrial development; the political economy of development strategy; and the relationship between state capacity and growth. My current projects have focused on Asian economic development, using applied econometric methods and archival data.

  <h2>Job Market Paper</h2>

  <p><h4>Manufacturing Revolutions [Coming soon]</h4>Industrial Policy and Networks in South Korea</br></p>

  <p>
	<b>Abstract</b> - This paper uses a natural experiment and newly digitized data from South Korea to estimate the causal effect of industrial policy on (short- and long-run) industrial development. In 1973 South Korea transitioned to a military dictatorship and drastically changed their development strategy. I find industries targeted by the regime's big push grew significantly more than non-targeted industries along several key dimensions of industrial development. These developmental effects persisted after industrial policies were retrenched, following the 1979 assassination of the president. Furthermore, I estimate the spillovers of the industrial policies using exogenous variation in the exposure to the policy across the input-output network. I find evidence of persistent pecuniary externalities like those posited by big push development theorists, such as Albert Hirschman. In other words, I find that South Korea’s controversial industrial policy was successful in producing industrial development, the benefits of which persisted through time and in industries not directly targeted by the policies.
