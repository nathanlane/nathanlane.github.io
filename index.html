  <h2>Ph.D. Job Market Candidate, 2016-2017</h2>
	<p><a href = "http://www.iies.su.se/" target="_blank">Institute for International Economic Studies, Stockholm Sweden</a></p>

  	<p>My research broadly focuses on economic development, political economy, and economic history. Specifically, I am interested in industrial development; the political economy of development strategy; long-run growth and structural change; and elite politics. My studies focus on the developmental experiences of East and Southeast Asia, combined with historical and archival data.</p>

  <p><h4>Manufacturing Revolutions [Coming soon]</h4>Industrial Policy and Networks in South Korea</br></p>

  <p>
	<b>Abstract</b> - This paper uses a natural experiment to estimate the causal effect of industrial policy on short and long-run industrial development with newly digitized, historic data from South Korea. Using the sudden shift in industrial strategy in 1973, following South Korea’s transition to military dictatorship, I find that industries targeted by big push-style industrial policies grew more than non-targeted industries, improving along several key measures of industrial development; these effects persisted long after industrial policies were retrenched after the 1979 assassination of the South Korean president, the big push’s chief architect. Furthermore, I estimate the spillovers of the industrial policies using exogenous variation in the exposure to the policy across input-output linkages. I find that non-targeted industries downstream from targeted sectors benefited significantly from the policy, while less advanced upstream sectors contracted. To conclude, I find that South Korea’s controversial industrial policies were successful in producing industrial development, the benefits of which persisted through time and in industries not directly targeted by the policies.
