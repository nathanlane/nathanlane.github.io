Industrial Policy and Networks in South Korea

`Abstract` 
This paper uses a natural experiment and newly digitized data from South Korea to estimate the causal effect of industrial policy on (short- and long-run) industrial development. In 1973 South Korea transitioned to a military dictatorship and drastically changed their development strategy. I find industries targeted by the regime's big push grew significantly more than non-targeted industries along several key dimensions of industrial development. These developmental effects persisted after industrial policies were retrenched, following the 1979 assassination of the president. Furthermore, I estimate the spillovers of the industrial policies using exogenous variation in the exposure to the policy across the input-output network. I find evidence of persistent pecuniary externalities like those posited by big push development theorists, such as Albert Hirschman. In other words, I find that South Korea’s controversial industrial policy was successful in producing industrial development, the benefits of which persisted through time and in industries not directly targeted by the policies.

`Title` 
__State Capacity, Local Governance, and Economic Development in Vietnam__

with Melissa Dell (Harvard) and Pablo Querubin (NYU)

`Abstract` 
There has been a large divergence in economic prosperity between Northeast and Southeast Asia since the mid-20th century, and the governance organizations and norms of Asian societies plausibly explain this divergence. This study examines the impacts of different historical governance norms on development using Vietnam as a laboratory. Northern Vietnam (Dai Viet) was ruled by strong state institutions inherited from China. It governed through a centralized, competitively selected bureaucracy, and the village was the fundamental administrative unit. Southern Vietnam was a weak tributary of the Khmer (Cambodian) Empire. It followed a patron-client model with more personalized power relations and no village intermediation. We use a regression discontinuity design across the Dai Viet-Khmer boundary to compare villages that had a strong state to nearby areas that did not. We find that areas historically under the strong state have higher living standards today. Using rich data from South Vietnam and the unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam, we document that in villages with a bureaucratic historical state, citizens have been better able to organize for public goods and redistribution through stronger local governments and civil society. Overall the study suggests that the bureaucratic state in East Asia - deeply embedded in civil society - played a central role in this region’s growth.
