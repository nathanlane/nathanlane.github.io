---has broader benefits to scholars. This intimacy can inform the questions we ask.<br />

I couldn't help thinking this view has application in economics, especially since I have been reading work from the great Zvi Griliches, who was a champion of the insights to be gleaned from the <em>process</em> of data collection. His emphasis on the value of data in economics is reflected in his 1994 presidential address to the American Economic Association:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Zvi Griliches</b>,</p>
<blockquote><p>
"We ourselves do not put enough emphasis on the value of data and data collection in our training of graduate students and in the reward structure of our profession."
</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
With that in mind, it's hard to imagine many of Griliches insights, the least of which his work on productivity and technological adoption, without a granular appreciation weighing through the muck of data. You certainly get a sense of this <strong><a href="http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.14.2.171">from his interview with Alan Krueger</a></strong>.</p>
