Delving into the fantastic collection of the Norwegian <strong><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/trondheim_byarkiv/"> Municipal Archives of Trondheim</a></strong>, which has some eerie photograph's from journalist Eirik Sundvor's visit to Stalinist-era Soviet Union (among many other beautiful gems.)
