As an undergraduate suffering through a graduate PhD micro course, I recall my professor bringing up the "hot new thing" that was implementation theory. I tried hard at the time to ascertain what this literature was.

The other day a colleague of mine mentioned that he was relieved by the direction network economics as going, with more applied studies and an increasing number of empirically-grounded studies. "If that hadn't happened," he said, "it may have gone the way of implementation theory." 

With that, it hit me: _what the hell happened to implementation theory?_ So I tweeted into the Econ Twitter black hole.

Thus starts his thread with a fantastic piece by Matt Jackson (of current network theory fame): A Crash Course in Implementation Theory (2001). Which is a glimpse into the (then) state of the art.

With a also a little lit review.

The two articles are from Matt Jackson (1992), and Maskin and Jean Tirole (1999):

> [Jackson, M. O. (1992). Implementation in Undominated Strategies: A Look at Bounded Mechanisms. The Review of Economic Studies, 59(4), 757–775](http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2297996). \[Ungated: [Link](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/math/papers/833.pdf)\] 

> [Maskin, E., & Tirole, J. (1999). Unforeseen Contingencies and Incomplete Contracts.

But Ben then gives a nice synopsis of what happened.
