This is a bit of a literature review of recent papers on industrial policy, and related topics.

**Protection: Temporary and Otherwise.**  
![](/uploads/2019/01/17/e010782410-v8.jpg)  
Reka Juhasz (2018) paper has been widely discussed, but it one of the first attempts to unpack the impact of infant industry policy using contemporary causal inference. In this case using the Napoleonic blockade of England as a short-term shock that a) mimicked a temporary protection policy of French textile producers, the spatial scope of which meant b) different regions of French producers were subjected to different amounts of protect. A lot, of course, has been written about this paper elsewhere (rightly so!). As well, a new paper Bécuwe and Blancheton (2018) considers the role of protection and the long-run impact on British textiles, albeit from a more case-study approach.

Industrial policy is often associated with postwar East Asian economies and the input substitution industrialization (ISI) of Latin American. Of course, most Western nations pursued significant industrial policies throughout their development path. One canonical example is Canada's National Policy in the late 19th century. An interesting wave of papers covering period of protectionism Alexander and Keay (2018), Harris, Keay, and Lewis (2015), and Inwood, and Keay, (2013).

**Temporary Subsidies and SpilloversManagerial and technological interventionsManagerial and technological interventions**

Temporary interventions and spillovers  
**Besides temporary protection of output _per se_, a number of studies have considered the effect of other temporary interventions. For example, Hanlon (2018), considers how the temporary cost advantages related to steel jump-started the U.K.'s lead in metal ship building, and the role labor market spillovers played in maintaining their leadership. On the other side of the Atlantic, Hanlon focuses on how interventions allowed U.S. producers to transition from wood to steel.

Mitrunen (2019), who also looks at the labor market spillovers of a particularly interesting intervention: Finland's postwar reparation's to the Soviet Union. The reparations mandated that Finland pay Stalin in the form of heavy industrial commodities. Accordingly, Mitrunen studies the policy as a type of forced export industrial policy, also focusing on the effects on skilled labor--contemporaneous and inter generational effects.

Jaworski and Smyth (2018) considers how U.S. government purchases during wartime helped the "big names" of the U.S. aeronautical industry. In particular, these purchases allowed U.S. manufacturers survive later turbulent periods of shakeout. 

Similarly, in this bucket, is also my own study on South Korea's heavy chemical and industry big push. Here (Lane 2017), I focus on the impact of a temporary big push policy, emphasizing linkage effects of industrial targeting. \[[Read my piece on this here.](https://voxdev.org/topic/firms-trade/manufacturing-revolutions-role-industrial-policy-south-korea-s-industrialisation)\]

Managerial and technological interventions  
**  
Giorcelli (2019) is a fantastic take on a large industrial intervention. The factor accumulation promoted by the Marshall Plan across Western Europe looms large as an explanation behind "Les Trente Glorieuses"—the decades of sustained economic growth following World War II. Giorcelli focuses on the long-run implications of a particularly successful Marshall Plan project in Italy, the United States Technical Assistance and Productivity Program (1952–58). Specifically, the policy focused on both transferring technology--and more importantly--modern managment techniques to Italian firms:
