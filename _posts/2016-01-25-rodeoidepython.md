Just a quick heads-up: I've been using __[Yhat's new Python IDE, Rodeo](https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo)__, which is pretty awesome for data-centric work.

I've been looking for something that feels like __[good ol' RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com)__, an IDE for R that I keep returning to no matter how much I tend to use other advanced text editors.
