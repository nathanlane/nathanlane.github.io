Norwegian population settlement in the United States (and Canada) at the turn of the century. 

![Norwegian Population Settlement in the U.S.](http://pages.stolaf.edu/locluth/files/2014/07/Norlie-settlement-map-e1406570641845.png)

From the **["Locating Lutherans" project](http://pages.stolaf.edu/locluth/project/usa-scale/)**. Originally from (I believe), **[Olaf Morgan Norlie's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_M._Norlie)** "History of the Norwegian People in America Paperback" (1925). 

On the subject of Scandinavian immigration and its effect _in Scandinavia_, I highly recommend the recent job market paper by my colleagues **Mounir Karadja** and **Erik Prawitz**, ["Exit, Voice and Political Change: Evidence from Swedish Mass Migration to the United States"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qmxomggukmflct6/KaradjaPrawitz2015-ExitVoicePoliticalChange.pdf?dl=0?raw=1 "Exit, Voice and Political Change: Evidence from Swedish Mass Migration to the United States").
