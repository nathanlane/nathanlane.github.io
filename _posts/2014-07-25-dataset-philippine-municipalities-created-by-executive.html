<p>Oh boy. Doing panel econometrics and economic history in developing countries is awful. One problem, ALWAYS, is when we want to match historical data to contemporary data. Doing so entails historic shapefiles or datasets that allow us to track administrative boundary changes; these things are seldom available for places like the Philippines. </p>
<p>So here is a little dataset that lists new municipalities created by executive order (only) from 1936-1965</p>
<p><a class="mode-embed" href="https://modeanalytics.com/nathanlane/reports/d49d172cca04/embed">Philippine Executive Order Municipalities, 1936-1965 - Table on Mode.</a></p>
<p><span>Note this does not list the &#8220;mother&#8221; municipalities. </span></p>
