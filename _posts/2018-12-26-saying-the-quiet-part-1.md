It's often revealing when someone when someone "says the quiet part loud." I thought this was particularly resonant:

> We are fortunate that, thanks to globalisation, policy decisions in the  US have been largely replaced by global market forces. National security  aside, it hardly makes any difference who will be the next president.  The world is governed by market forces.  
>
> \-Alan Greenspan, 2007, interview with a Swiss newspaper.
>
> op cit. Tooze (2018) "Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World" 

I suspect this may be more true for the developing world than OECD countries. Regardless, though, I think do not think it is a radical statement there is a conflict between domestic political goals (globally) and the rules governing the international economic system. 

Just ask the architects. The is a point captured in the recent book, "Globalists: The End of Empire and the Birth of Neoliberalism" by Quinn Slobodian. (Coincidentally, quote is also in the introduction.)
